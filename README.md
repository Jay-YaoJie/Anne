  # I love you
    
  Not for what you are,
  But for what I am
  When I am with you. 

  I love you,
  Not only for what
  You have made of yourself,
  But for what
  You are making of me.

  I love you
  For the part of me
  That you bring out;

  I love you
  For putting your hand
  Into my heaped-up heart
  And passing over
  All the foolish, weak things
  That you canâ€™t help
  Dimly seeing there,
  And for drawing out
  Into the light
  All the beautiful belongings
  That no one else had looked
  Quite far enough to find.

  I love you because you
  Are helping me to make
  Of the lumber of my life
  Not a tavern
  But a temple;
  Out of the works
  Of my every day
  Not a reproach
  But a song.

  I love you
  Because you have done
  More than any creed
  Could have done
  To make me good
  And more than any fate
  Could have done
  To make me happy.
  You have done it
  Without a touch,
  Without a word,
  Without a sign.
  You have done it
  By being yourself.
